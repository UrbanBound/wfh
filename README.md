# This is a program that makes it easy to set WFH updates
Really, at this point, it's just a script and it is a serious misuse of the Go language

#Set up
1. Set up Go. Maybe use brew or something idgaf
2. [Get yourself some API secrets from google](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=calendar) (dude, they give them to you FOR FREE)
3. Set your PRODUCT_WFH_CALENDAR_ID environment variable in your ~/.bash_profile to the thing that @mkuipers tells you
3. Set your WFH_DISPLAY_CALENDAR_NAME environment variable in your ~/.bash_profile to "#{first_name} {last_initial}" (e.g. Max K)
